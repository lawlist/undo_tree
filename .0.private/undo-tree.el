;;; Commentary by @lawlist:
;;;
;;; System Requirements:  (version-list-<= (version-to-list emacs-version) '(26 0 90))
;;;
;;; Emacs 26 (master branch) is incompatible with `undo-tree' for several reasons,
;;; which include, but are not limited to:  (1) @npostavs stated, "structs are
;;; now records in Emacs 26, before they were just vectors with a special symbol
;;; in the first element".  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/34314/2287
;;; (2) @lawlist is experiencing stack overflow issues on OSX 10.6.8 when calling the
;;; `print' family of functions (bug #27571) and `read' (bug #27779) -- the trick of
;;; `ulimit -S -s unlimited` is no longer a viable workaround.
;;;
;;; This unofficial modification by @lawlist to the `undo-tree.el` library authored
;;; by Toby Cubitt adds semi-linear undo/redo support and a corresponding visualizer
;;; view accessible with `C-u C-x u` or by using the 3-way toggle with the letter `t`
;;; in the visualization buffer.  This entire library is meant to be a replacement
;;; of the stock version of `undo-tree.el` -- i.e., the stock version should be
;;; removed from the `load-path'.  In the visualization buffer, the letters `u` / `r`
;;; or `z` / `Z` are used for semi-linear undo/redo.  In the working buffer,
;;; `super-u` / `super-r` or `super-z` / `super-Z` are used for semi-linear undo/redo.
;;; Semi-linear undo/redo also work in the classic views of the visualization buffer.
;;; All previous keyboard shortcuts remain unchanged.  The mouse can be used to
;;; select semi-linear nodes or branch-point timestamps in the visualization buffer.
;;;
;;; The term `semi-linear` was chosen because the time-line is generally structured
;;; as follows:  When undoing, the movement is in an upward direction from the
;;; leaf to the branch-point and then the previous branch begins undoing from the
;;; leaf.  When redoing, the movement is in a downward direction from the branch-
;;; point to the leaf and then the next branch begins redoing from the branch-point.
;;; It is not a situation where we walk-up and back-down the same branch, or walk-
;;; down and back-up the same branch again.  If that missing feature is useful,
;;; then perhaps it could be implemented someday....
;;;
;;; In a nutshell, the classic version of undo-tree undo/redo limits a user to
;;; the active branch (skipping over inactive branches), unless the user calls
;;; `undo-tree-switch-branch' or `undo-tree-visual-switch-branch-right' or
;;; `undo-tree-visual-switch-branch-left' to select an alternative branch.  This
;;; generally means a user must pop-open the visualizer buffer to see what is going
;;; on to make a proper decision.  The new semi-linear feature is essentially
;;; `mindless` where the user can just hold down the forward/reverse button and
;;; go through every node of the tree in chronological order -- i.e., all branches
;;; and nodes are visited in the process (nothing is skipped over).
;;;
;;; The labels in the visualization buffer remain the same:  `o`, `x`, `s`, register.
;;; The branches are labeled consecutively as they are drawn with lowercase letters.
;;; The branch-points are labeled consecutively as they are drawn with uppercase
;;; letters.  The branches coming off of each branch-point are labeled with the nth
;;; numeric position of the branch -- e.g., far left is always nth 0.  The nodes of
;;; each branch are numbered consecutively commencing just after the branch-point.
;;;
;;; The features that are available in `undo-tree.el` version 0.6.6 remain the same;
;;; however, some of the functions have been consolidated and the names have changed.
;;;
;;; `undo-tree-history-save' and `undo-tree-history-restore' support input/output
;;; to/from a string or a file.  The history string/file contains three components:
;;; `buffer-file-name' (if it exists; else `nil`); SHA1 string; the `undo-tree-list'.
;;; Histories created with the unmodified stock version of `undo-tree.el` contained 2
;;; components and those previous versions are no longer supported.  Saving/exporting
;;; excludes all text-properties, yasnippet entries, and multiple-cursors entries.
;;; `read' chokes when encountering #<marker in no buffer> or #<overlay in no buffer>,
;;; that can make their way into the `undo-tree-list' when killing the visualizer
;;; buffer by brute force or when using an older yasnippet library.  [Note that the
;;; latest version of yasnippet has reportedly fixed this problem.  See pull request
;;; https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet/pull/804.]  Those two known situations
;;; have been dealt with programmatically.  However, there are surely other libraries
;;; that use markers and/or overlays that could make their way into the tree and new
;;; ways of dealing with those entries will be required.  If you encounter an error
;;; when performing `undo-tree-history-save', please inspect the `*Messages*` buffer
;;; for clues such as the above examples.  Inasmuch as there is now a sanity check
;;; at the tail end of `undo-tree-history-save', any problems `should` materialize
;;; before a user actually tries to restore the history.
;;;
;;; The persistent undo storage has been expanded by adding certain features borrowed
;;; from the built-in `image-dired.el' library:
;;;
;;; `undo-tree-history-autosave':  When non-nil, `undo-tree-mode' will save undo
;;;                                history to a file when a buffer is saved; and,
;;;                                restore the history file (if it exists) when
;;;                                undo-tree-mode is turned on.
;;;
;;; `undo-tree-history-alist':  Used when `undo-tree-history-storage' is 'classic.
;;;                             See the doc-string for customization tips/tricks.
;;;
;;; `undo-tree-history-directory':  Directory where history files are stored when
;;;                                `undo-tree-history-storage' is 'central.
;;;
;;; `undo-tree-history-storage':  How to store undo-tree history files.
;;;                               'classic:  See `undo-tree-history-alist'.
;;;                               'home (md5):  A folder in the HOME directory.
;;;                               'central (md5):  See `undo-tree-history-directory'.
;;;                               'local:  Create sub-directory in working directory.
;;;
;;; The following customizable variables are used to exclude major-modes, buffer
;;; names, and absolute file names from `undo-tree-mode':
;;;
;;;   -  `undo-tree-exclude-modes'
;;;   -  `undo-tree-exclude-buffers'
;;;   -  `undo-tree-exclude-files'
;;;
;;; For those users who wish to use Emacs to view the saved/exported history, be
;;; aware that the undo history is one long string, and Emacs has trouble viewing a
;;; buffer with very long lines.  `(setq-default bidi-display-reordering nil)` will
;;; help permit Emacs to view buffers with very long lines without bogging down.
;;;
;;; The primary interactive functions for undo/redo in the working buffer are:
;;;
;;;   M-x undo-tree-classic-undo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-classic-redo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-linear-undo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-linear-redo
;;;
;;; The primary interactive functions for undo/redo in the visualization buffer are:
;;;
;;;   M-x undo-tree-visual-classic-undo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-visual-classic-redo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-visual-linear-undo
;;;   M-x undo-tree-visual-linear-redo
;;;
;;; If the built-in undo amalgamation business is not to your liking, it can be
;;; disabled to permit undo boundaries after every command:
;;;
;;;   (cancel-timer undo-auto-current-boundary-timer)
;;;   (fset 'undo-auto--undoable-change
;;;         (lambda () (add-to-list 'undo-auto--undoably-changed-buffers (current-buffer))))
;;;   (fset 'undo-auto-amalgamate 'ignore)
;;;
;;; GARBAGE COLLECTION:  `truncate_undo_list' in `undo.c`
;;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=27214
;;; If the `undo-limit' and `undo-strong-limit' are set too low, then garbage
;;; collection may silently truncate the `buffer-undo-list', leading to
;;; `undo-tree-transfer-list' replacing the existing `undo-tree-list' with
;;; the new tree fragment obtained from the `buffer-undo-list'.  In this
;;; circumstance, the user loses the entire undo-tree saved history!  The internal
;;; function responsible is `truncate_undo_list' in `undo.c`.  @lawlist has added a
;;; programmatic warning in `undo-tre-transfer-list' when loss of the existing
;;; `undo-tree-list' is about to occur; however, `truncate_undo_list' has already
;;; thrown something out in that case.  To avoid this situation, the user should
;;; consider increasing the default values for `undo-limit' and `undo-strong-limit'.
;;
;;; CRASHING -- SEGMENTATION FAULT:  `undo-tree-history-save'
;;; http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=27571
;;; The `undo-tree-list' is a lisp object consisting of nested vectors and lists,
;;; which is circular.  When the structure becomes large, Emacs will crash when
;;; printing the `undo-tree-list' with functions such as `prin1'; `print';
;;; `prin1-to-string'; etc.  The persistent history feature relies upon printing
;;; the `undo-tree-list' variable so that its value can be stored to a file.
;;; The crashing is caused because the default ulimit stack size is too low.
;;; In responding to Emacs bug report 27571, @npostavs determined that the issue
;;; can be fixed by setting the ulimit stack size with:  ulimit -S -s unlimited
;;; @lawlist has implemented this fix by starting Emacs with a bash script:
;;;     #!/bin/sh
;;;     ulimit -S -s unlimited
;;;     /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs &
;;; Perhaps the Emacs team will implement a built-in fix in the future.  The bug
;;; report remains open at this time, but at least we have a viable workaround.
;;; Another workaround is to truncate the `undo-tree-list' if it would exceed a
;;; specified number of nodes; e.g., 6651.  `undo-tree-transfer-list' contains a
;;; commented out call to `undo-tree-discard-history--two-of-two' which has a
;;; hard-coded limit of 6500 nodes.
;;;
;;; ERROR:  `Unrecognized entry in undo list undo-tree-canary`
;;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=16377
;;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=16523
;;; The built-in function named `primitive-undo' defined in `simple.el` was used
;;; in the original version of `undo-tree.el`.  @lawlist created a modified
;;; function named `undo-tree--primitive-undo' that serves the same purpose, but
;;; permits setting a window-point in the working buffer while a user is in a
;;; different window such as the visualization buffer.  The revised version also
;;; merely reports a problem with a message instead of throwing an error when it
;;; encounters an `undo-tree-canary' in the wrong location.  Dr. Cubitt recommends
;;; not using the undo/redo-in-region feature until he has an opportunity to fix it.

;;; 1.  In an internet browser, visit: https://www.lawlist.com/lisp/undo-tree.el
;;;
;;;     Select/highlight all and copy everything to the clipboard.
;;;
;;; 2.  Launch Emacs without any user settings whatsoever:  emacs -q
;;;
;;;     If possible, please use the latest stable public release of Emacs.
;;;     @lawlist is using the GUI version of Emacs 25.2.1 on OSX.
;;;
;;; 3.  Switch to the `*scratch*` buffer.
;;;
;;; 4.  Paste the entire contents of the clipboard into the `*scratch*` buffer.
;;;
;;; 5.  M-x eval-buffer RET

;;; 6.  M-x eval-expression RET (setq undo-tree-history-autosave t) RET
;;;
;;; 7.  M-x undo-tree-mode RET
;;;
;;;     The mode-line indicates `UT`, meaning that `undo-tree-mode' is active.
;;;
;;; 8.  M-x save-buffer RET
;;;
;;;     @lawlist chose to save the file to his desktop with the name `foo`, and
;;;     also chose to overwrite the file if it already existed; i.e., `y`.
;;;
;;;     Look at the lower left-hand side of the mode-line and notice that it
;;;     indicates an unmodified state; i.e., U:--- foo ....
;;;
;;; 9.  M-x undo-tree-classic-undo RET
;;;
;;;     Look at the lower left-hand side of the mode-line and notice that it
;;;     indicates we have returned to a modified state; i.e., U:**- foo ....

;;;     The `undo-tree' library that we had previously pasted to the `*scratch*`
;;;     buffer should now be completely undone; i.e., removed.
;;;
;;; 11. M-x undo-tree-classic-undo RET
;;;
;;;     The buffer should be completely empty at this point; i.e., the initial

;;;     The following `user-error' appears:

;;;     This is exactly the behavior that @lawlist expected would happen, so
;;;     everything up to this point appears to be working correctly.

;;; 
;;; There are two undo commands, `undo' and `undo-only'. `undo-only' will only undo,
;;; skipping undoing undos (redoing).
;;; 
;;; The rules:
;;; 
;;;     All changes, including undos, get added to the front of the undo chain.
;;;     `undo' moves back one state along the undo chain.
;;;     `undo-only' moves back one state along the temporal axis.
;;;     `undo-only' always move backward along the temporal axis.
;;;     `undo' moves in the opposite direction along the temporal axis as the change it is undoing.
;;; 
;;; I encourage you to follow along with the example. Open up *scratch* and bind
;;; `undo-only' to an easy to press key; you don't want to use `M-x` for this.
;;; 
;;; First, insert some text
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o
;;; 
;;; Each node represents a buffer state. Each buffer state will be labeled with a letter.
;;; For convenience, type a `RET` to move to state A. The `RET` is an easy way to make Emacs
;;; set a break in the undo chain; otherwise Emacs will group contiguous inserts into one
;;; "state". Also, this state A is actually two states, the "inserted a" and "inserted RET"
;;; states. In this example, each undo will actually be two undos, one to undo the `RET` and
;;; one to undo the letter.
;;; 
;;; After following the above, your buffer should look like this:
;;; 
;;; a
;;; b
;;; c
;;; 
;;; Next, undo twice:
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 /
;;;                o
;;;               /
;;;              /
;;;             o
;;; 
;;; You are now back at state A. Note how the undo chain is presented here. The undos have
;;; been added to the end of the undo chain, however, the chain is now going backward temporally.
;;; We type some more:
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 /
;;;                o
;;;               /
;;;              / D  E
;;;    Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
;;; 
;;; Still simple. We keep going:
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 /
;;;                o
;;;               /
;;;              / D  E
;;;    Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 / F  G  H
;;;       Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                        /
;;;                       / I  J
;;;             Insert!  o--o--o
;;; 
;;; It's getting complex now; we'll start calling `undo-only' now:
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 /
;;;                o
;;;               /
;;;              / D  E
;;;    Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 / F  G  H
;;;       Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                        /
;;;                       / I  J
;;;             Insert!  o--o--o  `undo-only'
;;;                           /
;;;                   F  G   /
;;;                   o--o--o
;;; 
;;; Our first `undo-only' goes back one state to state I. So far so good.
;;; 
;;; Our second `undo-only' goes back one state to state G. So far so good.
;;; 
;;; Our third `undo-only' goes back three states to state F. However, we only went back
;;; only one state "temporally": we skipped all intervening undo/redo pairs.
;;; 
;;; We keep going.
;;; 
;;;             A  B  C
;;;  Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
;;;                  /
;;;                 /
;;;                o

;;;             o
;;; 
;;; Now we're all the way back to state A.  With `undo', we would have had to traverse every
;;; single state (count them, there's a lot), but with `undo-only', it only took five.
;;; 
;;; Now for the final stretch. We insert a few more fresh states:
;;;

;;; 
;;; Okay, what happened here? We undid the new states we added, and those undo actions
;;; get added going backward temporally. After that though, we started undoing undos.
;;; These undo changes get added with the reverse temporality as the original changes,
;;; so these undo changes are going forward temporally. If you did `undo-only' at this
;;; point, you would undo these changes.
;;; 
;;; (But wait, aren't these changes undo changes? `undo-only' doesn't undo undos, right?
;;; Well, these changes are actually undos of undos, so they're actually redos, not undos,
;;; hence why they move forward temporally.)
;;; 
;;; That's it for the example. Keep in mind however that this "undo chain" is just a concept
;;; to help understand how undo works. What Emacs actually stores is `buffer-undo-list'.
;;; You can check it out with describe-variable.
;;; 
;;; If you have been following along with the example, the state of `buffer-undo-list'
;;; should be like below. I have annotated it with points from the undo chain diagrams.

;;; Commentary by Toby Cubitt:
;;
;; Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in
;; most software, it allows you to recover *any* past state of a buffer
;; (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you
;; redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo
;; system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that
;; replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system.
;;
;; Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs'
;; undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of
;; changes. It's not. The `undo-tree-mode' provided by this package replaces
;; Emacs' undo system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
;; branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
;; behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the power of
;; never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history can in
;; some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate
;; before Emacs starts discarding history.
;;
;; The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it
;; was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the
;; best ideas from their competitors!
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; This package has only been tested with Emacs versions 24 and CVS. It should
;; work in Emacs versions 22 and 23 too, but will not work without
;; modifications in earlier versions of Emacs.
;;
;; To install `undo-tree-mode', make sure this file is saved in a directory in
;; your `load-path', and add the line:
;;
;;   (require 'undo-tree)
;;
;; to your .emacs file. Byte-compiling undo-tree.el is recommended (e.g. using
;; "M-x byte-compile-file" from within emacs).
;;
;; If you want to replace the standard Emacs' undo system with the
;; `undo-tree-mode' system in all buffers, you can enable it globally by
;; adding:
;;
;;   (global-undo-tree-mode)
;;
;; to your .emacs file.
;;
;;
;; Quick-Start
;; ===========
;;
;; If you're the kind of person who likes to jump in the car and drive,
;; without bothering to first figure out whether the button on the left dips
;; the headlights or operates the ejector seat (after all, you'll soon figure
;; it out when you push it), then here's the minimum you need to know:
;;
;; `undo-tree-mode' and `global-undo-tree-mode'
;;   Enable undo-tree mode (either in the current buffer or globally).
;;
;; C-_  C-/  (`undo-tree-classic-undo')
;;   Undo changes.
;;
;; M-_  C-?  (`undo-tree-classic-redo')
;;   Redo changes.
;;
;; `undo-tree-switch-branch'
;;   Switch undo-tree branch.
;;   (What does this mean? Better press the button and see!)
;;
;; C-x u  (`undo-tree-visual')
;;   Visualize the undo tree.
;;   (Better try pressing this button too!)
;;
;; C-x r u  (`undo-tree-save-state-to-register')

;;
;; Undo Systems
;; ============
;;
;; To understand the different undo systems, it's easiest to consider an
;; example. Imagine you make a few edits in a buffer. As you edit, you
;; accumulate a history of changes, which we might visualize as a string of
;; past buffer states, growing downwards:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;
;;
;; Now imagine that you undo the last two changes. We can visualize this as
;; rewinding the current state back two steps:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;;
;; However, this isn't a good representation of what Emacs' undo system
;; does. Instead, it treats the undos as *new* changes to the buffer, and adds
;; them to the history:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (buffer state before undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (second undo)
;;
;;
;; Actually, since the buffer returns to a previous state after an undo,
;; perhaps a better way to visualize it is to imagine the string of changes
;; turning back on itself:
;;
;;        (initial buffer state)  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                  (first edit)  o  x  (second undo)
;;                                |  |
;;                                |  |
;;                 (second edit)  o  o  (first undo)
;;                                | /
;;                                |/
;;                                o  (buffer state before undo)
;;
;; Treating undos as new changes might seem a strange thing to do. But the
;; advantage becomes clear as soon as we imagine what happens when you edit
;; the buffer again. Since you've undone a couple of changes, new edits will
;; branch off from the buffer state that you've rewound to. Conceptually, it
;; looks like this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (new edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; The standard undo/redo system only lets you go backwards and forwards
;; linearly. So as soon as you make that new edit, it discards the old
;; branch. Emacs' undo just keeps adding changes to the end of the string. So
;; the undo history in the two systems now looks like this:
;;
;;            Undo/Redo:                      Emacs' undo
;;
;;               o                                o
;;               |                                |
;;               |                                |
;;               o                                o  o
;;               .\                               |  |\
;;               . \                              |  | \
;;               .  x  (new edit)                 o  o  |
;;   (discarded  .                                | /   |
;;     branch)   .                                |/    |
;;               .                                o     |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      x  (new edit)
;;
;; Now, what if you change your mind about those undos, and decide you did
;; like those other changes you'd made after all? With the standard undo/redo
;; system, you're lost. There's no way to recover them, because that branch
;; was discarded when you made the new edit.
;;
;; However, in Emacs' undo system, those old buffer states are still there in
;; the undo history. You just have to rewind back through the new edit, and
;; back through the changes made by the undos, until you reach them. Of
;; course, since Emacs treats undos (even undos of undos!) as new changes,
;; you're really weaving backwards and forwards through the history, all the
;; time adding new changes to the end of the string as you go:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |
;;                       o  o     o  (undo new edit)
;;                       |  |\    |\
;;                       |  | \   | \
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  (undo the undo)
;;                       | /   |  |  |
;;                       |/    |  |  |
;;      (trying to get   o     |  |  x  (undo the undo)
;;       to this state)        | /
;;                             |/
;;                             o
;;
;; So far, this is still reasonably intuitive to use. It doesn't behave so
;; differently to standard undo/redo, except that by going back far enough you
;; can access changes that would be lost in standard undo/redo.
;;
;; However, imagine that after undoing as just described, you decide you
;; actually want to rewind right back to the initial state. If you're lucky,
;; and haven't invoked any command since the last undo, you can just keep on
;; undoing until you get back to the start:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o              x  (got there!)
;;       to this state)  |              |
;;                       |              |
;;                       o  o     o     o  (keep undoing)
;;                       |  |\    |\    |
;;                       |  | \   | \   |
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  o  (keep undoing)
;;                       | /   |  |  | /
;;                       |/    |  |  |/
;;      (already undid   o     |  |  o  (got this far)
;;       to this state)        | /
;;                             |/
;;                             o
;;
;; But if you're unlucky, and you happen to have moved the point (say) after
;; getting to the state labelled "got this far", then you've "broken the undo
;; chain". Hold on to something solid, because things are about to get
;; hairy. If you try to undo now, Emacs thinks you're trying to undo the
;; undos! So to get back to the initial state you now have to rewind through
;; *all* the changes, including the undos you just did:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o                          x  (finally got there!)
;;       to this state)  |                          |
;;                       |                          |
;;                       o  o     o     o     o     o
;;                       |  |\    |\    |\    |\    |
;;                       |  | \   | \   | \   | \   |
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  o  |  |  o  o
;;                       | /   |  |  | /   |  |  | /
;;                       |/    |  |  |/    |  |  |/
;;      (already undid   o     |  |  o<.   |  |  o
;;       to this state)        | /     :   | /
;;                             |/      :   |/
;;                             o       :   o
;;                                     :
;;                             (got this far, but
;;                              broke the undo chain)
;;
;; Confused?
;;
;; In practice you can just hold down the undo key until you reach the buffer
;; state that you want. But whatever you do, don't move around in the buffer
;; to *check* that you've got back to where you want! Because you'll break the
;; undo chain, and then you'll have to traverse the entire string of undos
;; again, just to get back to the point at which you broke the
;; chain. Undo-in-region and commands such as `undo-only' help to make using
;; Emacs' undo a little easier, but nonetheless it remains confusing for many
;; people.
;;
;;
;; So what does `undo-tree-mode' do? Remember the diagram we drew to represent
;; the history we've been discussing (make a few edits, undo a couple of them,
;; and edit again)? The diagram that conceptually represented our undo
;; history, before we started discussing specific undo systems? It looked like
;; this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (current state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; Well, that's *exactly* what the undo history looks like to
;; `undo-tree-mode'.  It doesn't discard the old branch (as standard undo/redo
;; does), nor does it treat undos as new changes to be added to the end of a
;; linear string of buffer states (as Emacs' undo does). It just keeps track
;; of the tree of branching changes that make up the entire undo history.
;;
;; If you undo from this point, you'll rewind back up the tree to the previous
;; state:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (undo)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; If you were to undo again, you'd rewind back to the initial state. If on
;; the other hand you redo the change, you'll end up back at the bottom of the
;; most recent branch:
;;
;;                                o  (undo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (redo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; So far, this is just like the standard undo/redo system. But what if you
;; want to return to a buffer state located on a previous branch of the
;; history? Since `undo-tree-mode' keeps the entire history, you simply need
;; to tell it to switch to a different branch, and then redo the changes you
;; want:
;;

;; Trying to imagine what Emacs' undo would do as you move about such a tree
;; will likely frazzle your brain circuits! But in `undo-tree-mode', you're
;; just moving around this undo history tree. Most of the time, you'll
;; probably only need to stay on the most recent branch, in which case it
;; behaves like standard undo/redo, and is just as simple to understand. But
;; if you ever need to recover a buffer state on a different branch, the
;; possibility of switching between branches and accessing the full undo
;; history is still there.
;;
;;
;;
;; The Undo-Tree Visualizer
;; ========================
;;
;; Actually, it gets better. You don't have to imagine all these tree
;; diagrams, because `undo-tree-mode' includes an undo-tree visualizer which
;; draws them for you! In fact, it draws even better diagrams: it highlights
;; the node representing the current buffer state, it highlights the current
;; branch, and you can toggle the display of time-stamps (by hitting "t") and
;; a diff of the undo changes (by hitting "d"). (There's one other tiny
;; difference: the visualizer puts the most recent branch on the left rather
;; than the right.)
;;
;; Bring up the undo tree visualizer whenever you want by hitting "C-x u".
;;
;; In the visualizer, the usual keys for moving up and down a buffer instead
;; move up and down the undo history tree (e.g. the up and down arrow keys, or
;; "C-n" and "C-p"). The state of the "parent" buffer (the buffer whose undo
;; history you are visualizing) is updated as you move around the undo tree in
;; the visualizer. If you reach a branch point in the visualizer, the usual
;; keys for moving forward and backward in a buffer instead switch branch
;; (e.g. the left and right arrow keys, or "C-f" and "C-b").
;;
;; Clicking with the mouse on any node in the visualizer will take you
;; directly to that node, resetting the state of the parent buffer to the
;; state represented by that node.
;;
;; You can also select nodes directly using the keyboard, by hitting "s" to
;; toggle selection mode. The usual motion keys now allow you to move around
;; the tree without changing the parent buffer. Hitting <enter> will reset the
;; state of the parent buffer to the state represented by the currently
;; selected node.
;;
;; It can be useful to see how long ago the parent buffer was in the state
;; represented by a particular node in the visualizer. Hitting "t" in the
;; visualizer toggles the display of time-stamps for all the nodes. (Note
;; that, because of the way `undo-tree-mode' works, these time-stamps may be
;; somewhat later than the true times, especially if it's been a long time
;; since you last undid any changes.)
;;
;; To get some idea of what changes are represented by a given node in the
;; tree, it can be useful to see a diff of the changes. Hit "d" in the
;; visualizer to toggle a diff display. This normally displays a diff between
;; the current state and the previous one, i.e. it shows you the changes that
;; will be applied if you undo (move up the tree). However, the diff display
;; really comes into its own in the visualizer's selection mode (see above),
;; where it instead shows a diff between the current state and the currently
;; selected state, i.e. it shows you the changes that will be applied if you
;; reset to the selected state.
;;
;; (Note that the diff is generated by the Emacs `diff' command, and is
;; displayed using `lawlist-diff-mode'. See the corresponding customization groups if
;; you want to customize the diff display.)
;;
;; Finally, hitting "q" will quit the visualizer, leaving the parent buffer in
;; whatever state you ended at. Hitting "C-q" will abort the visualizer,
;; returning the parent buffer to whatever state it was originally in when the
;; visualizer was invoked.
;;
;;
;;
;; Undo-in-Region
;; ==============
;;
;; Emacs allows a very useful and powerful method of undoing only selected
;; changes: when a region is active, only changes that affect the text within
;; that region will be undone. With the standard Emacs undo system, changes
;; produced by undoing-in-region naturally get added onto the end of the
;; linear undo history:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |  x  (second undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |
;;                       |  |
;;                       |  o  (first undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |
;;                       | /
;;                       |/
;;                       o
;;
;; You can of course redo these undos-in-region as usual, by undoing the
;; undos:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |  o_
;;                       o  | \
;;                       |  |  |
;;                       |  o  o  (undo the undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |  |
;;                       | /   |
;;                       |/    |
;;                       o     x  (undo the undo-in-region)
;;
;;
;; In `undo-tree-mode', undo-in-region works much the same way: when there's
;; an active region, undoing only undoes changes that affect that region. In
;; `undo-tree-mode', redoing when there's an active region similarly only
;; redoes changes that affect that region.
;;
;; However, the way these undo- and redo-in-region changes are recorded in the
;; undo history is quite different. The good news is, you don't need to
;; understand this to use undo- and redo-in-region in `undo-tree-mode' - just
;; go ahead and use them! They'll probably work as you expect. But if you're
;; masochistic enough to want to understand conceptually what's happening to
;; the undo tree as you undo- and redo-in-region, then read on...
;;
;;
;; Undo-in-region creates a new branch in the undo history. The new branch
;; consists of an undo step that undoes some of the changes that affect the
;; current region, and another step that undoes the remaining changes needed
;; to rejoin the previous undo history.

be drawn initially, and the tree will be extended later as
needed. For the most part, the only visible effect of this is to
significantly speed up displaying the visualizer for very large
trees.
-  There is one potential negative effect of lazy drawing. Other
branches of the tree will only be drawn once the node from which
they branch off becomes visible. So it can happen that certain
portions of the tree that would be shown with lazy drawing
disabled, will not be drawn immediately when it is

is active by using the function `buffer-local-variables', which excludes
the `buffer-undo-list':  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/3725/2287.

;;; Change Log

;; 2017-12-03  @lawlist:  When a user tries to use undo-tree.el on an Emacs version
;;             greater than '(26 0 90), the minor-mode now exits gracefully with
;;             a message instead of signalling an error.
;;
;; 2017-07-13  @lawlist:  Turned comments of several functions into doc-strings.
;;             Corrected the link to the functions written by @Tobias.
;;
;; 2017-07-08  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-discard-history--one-of-two' now uses three new
;;             variables:  `undo-tree--undo-limit'; `undo-tree--undo-strong-limit';
;;             and `undo-tree--undo-outer-limit'.
;;
;; 2017-07-05  @lawlist:  Added a notation to the commentary regarding bug #27571.
;;             Added a custom `mode-line-format' for the visualization buffer.
;;             Added `undo-tree-discard-history--two-of-two', which is not needed
;;             if the user starts Emacs as recommended in the commentary.
;;             `undo-tree-history-save' has been modified to use `prin1-to-string'
;;             instead of `prin1'.  Moved several items from `undo-tree-visual' to
;;             `undo-tree-visual-mode'.  Everything relating to the visualizer now
;;             uses the word `visual`.  Updated commentary regarding known bugs.
;;             Added a `change-major-mode-hook' to prompt for saving the buffer and
;;             history file.
;;
;; 2017-06-27  @lawlist:  Identified a new situation that merits documenting an
;;             example of how to replicate -- added to `undo-tree-transfer-list'.
;;
;; 2017-06-26  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-history-restore' is now triggered when turning
;;             on `undo-tree-mode' if `undo-tree-history-autosave' is non-nil.  If
;;             a history file is not found and restored successfully, then run
;;             `undo-tree-transfer-list' to initialize everything.
;;
;; 2017-06-25  @lawlist:  Updated commentary with a notation regarding the latest
;;             version of yasnippet reportedly having fixed the problem with
;;             `#<overlay in no buffer>` making its way into the `undo-tree-list'.
;;
;; 2017-06-21  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-announce-branch-point' now includes the node
;;             status if it is unmodified within the context of a call to
;;             `undo-tree-node-unmodified-p' (see the doc-string).  Added a new
;;             variable `undo-tree-exclude-buffers' and a new function to match
;;             excluded buffers `undo-tree-regexp-match-p'. `undo-tree-transfer-list'
;;             is now called when enabling `undo-tree-mode' -- this will avoid
;;             problems when dealing with indirect / direct buffers.
;;             The initial node is now time-stamped for semi-linear purposes as
;;             `00:00:00:00` so as to avoid a rare situation where the current node
;;             had the same timestamp as the initial node when initializing the tree
;;             with a populated `buffer-undo-list'.  `format-time-string' is using
;;             `t` for the TIMEZONE argument, but that can be changed in the future
;;             so that local time is used instead -- e.g., just test for a timestamp
;;             of '(0 0) and, if so, use `00:00:00:00` without `format-time-string'.
;;             Added warning for an indirect/direct buffer situation when no
;;             `undo-tree-list' is detected.  Both hooks and the global on function
;;             now have similar tests for exclusions.  Changed a some variable names.
;;             Some conditions of `global-undo-tree-mode' have been moved to
;;             the minor-mode definition.
;;
;; 2017-06-17  @lawlist:  The semi-linear visualization buffer timestamp faces are
;;             now customizable.  Reorganized a few functions/variables.
;;
;; 2017-06-11  @lawlist:  Reorganized the functions and variables.  The keymap for
;;             `undo-tree-mode' is now the standard naming convention; i.e.,
;;             `undo-tree-mode-map'.  Compatibility hacks for older versions of Emacs
;;             have been added back to the source code; however, older versions will
;;             not be tested by @lawlist; i.e., users will be encouraged to use a
;;             current version of Emacs.
;;
;; 2017-06-10  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-transfer-list' has been modified so that the
;;             initial check is to see whether the `buffer-undo-list' is `t`, instead
;;             of checking the `undo-tree-list'.  This appears to be a typographical
;;             error in the original going back in time prior to version 0.6.4.  The
;;             `undo-tree-list' would never be `t`, so the prior test was useless.
;;             Added an example to the commentary of a bug report recipe starting
;;             from emacs -q.
;;
;; 2017-06-08  @lawlist:  Added tests to throw an error if the hash-table is `nil'.
;;             See the bug list above:  (wrong-type-argument hash-table-p nil).
;;             Added a bug list to keep track of problems and work towards solutions.
;;             Added a cheat-sheet in the comments to better understand each element
;;             of the tree and node vectors.  Renamed the last remaining functions
;;             that did not conform to the `undo-tree-` prefix naming convention.
;;             `undo-tree-history-classic-filename' has been changed so that it no
;;             longer adds an extra dot to hidden file names.
;;
;; 2017-06-07  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-history-save' now generates a message when a
;;             `buffer-file-name' is not detected while performing the sanity check.
;;             `undo-tree-history-restore' no longer throws an error and aborts if
;;             a `buffer-file-name' is not detected -- just a message is generated.
;;
;; 2017-06-06  @lawlist:  Shortened the messages in `undo-tree-history-restore'.
;;
;; 2017-06-05  @lawlist:  Revised messages generated by `undo-tree-transfer-list'.
;;             Revised `undo-tree-history-save' and `undo-tree-history-restore' to
;;             treat a history file as the default situation, instead of a string;
;;             and, revised messages.  Licence and credits are now at the top,
;;             followed by the commentaries of @lawlist and Dr. Cubitt.  Added a
;;             paragraph to the commentary regarding `undo-tree--primitive-undo'.
;;
;; 2017-06-04  @lawlist:  Renamed additional functions and variables that did not
;;             coincide with the `undo-tree-` prefix.  Added pop-up warning message
;;             in `undo-tree-transfer-list' if the `undo-tree-list' is about to be
;;             replaced with a new tree fragment from the `buffer-undo-list'.  Added
;;             `undo-tree-exclude-files' along with commentary re same.
;;
;; 2017-06-03  @lawlist:  Revised commentary to include a section dealing with
;;             garbage collection truncation by truncate_undo_list' in `undo.c`.
;;
;; 2017-06-01  @lawlist:  Continued working on the new save/restore features based
;;             `image-dired.el'; renamed functions/variables; updated doc-strings;
;;             and revised commentary in relation thereto.  Discovered that the old
;;             `sha1` library that some users may still have lying around in their
;;             setup is substantially slower than the built-in `secure-hash'/`sha1'
;;             defined in `subr.el`.  Thus, a new function has been created
;;             to avoid using the older slower version -- i.e., we now use the
;;             function `undo-tree-sha1' which is a duplicate of `sha1' in `subr.el`.
;;
;; 2017-05-31  @lawlist:  `undo-tree-history-save' and `undo-tree-history-restore'
;;             now completely replace the previous stock versions that had similar
;;             names.  Revised commentary regarding said functions.  Modified the
;;             two persistent hook functions accordingly.  `undo-tree-history-save'
;;             has been revised to include `print-level' and `print-length' to `nil`
;;             just in case the user has customized the variables to be restrictive.
;;             Added an extra space of padding on each side of the visualizer semi-
;;             liner timestamps.  Added initial support for a centralized and local
;;             directory for storing the history files -- code is shamelessly copied
;;             directly from `image-dired.el' which uses the md5 standard.
;;
;; 2017-05-30  @lawlist:  Revised commentary to answer a couple of what will likely
;;             be frequently asked questions (FAQ).  Added a couple of comments to
;;             the code for history save/restore.  Corrected spelling of announce
;;             in the name of the function `undo-tree-announce-branch-point'.
;;
;; 2017-05-29  @lawlist:  Added warning messages to `undo-tree-discard-history--one-of-two'.
;;             Revised commentary.
;;
;; 2017-05-27  @lawlist:  Added new keyboard-shortcuts.  `undo-tree-history-save'
;;             and `undo-tree-history-restore' now contain `buffer-file-name', which
;;             precedes the hash string, and improved upon error messages.  Added
;;             commentary for the semi-linear feature.
;;
;; 2017-05-22  @lawlist:  Added back read-only warning to linear undo/redo.  The
;;             interactive asterisk command does not provide much information.
;;             Removed some custom run-hooks that are inapplicable to other users.
;;             Deactivate mark if a user says no thank you to undo/redo in region.
;;             Discovered undo-tree version 0.6.6 on the emacs-mirror and updated
;;             `undo-tree-copy-list', `undo-tree-update-menu-bar', and commentary.
;;             Removed redundant `(setq buffer-undo-list '(nil undo-tree-canary))`
;;             from the tail end of `undo-tree-transfer-list'.  Added a canary
;;             to the `buffer-undo-list' when calling `undo-tree-history-restore'.
;;
;; 2017-05-21  @lawlist:  Removed experimental sections for adding timestamps while
;;             maneuvering through the visualization buffer.
;;
;; 2017-05-20  @lawlist:  bug fix to `undo-tree-history-save'.  `ys--snippet-revive'
;;             entries in the `undo-tree-list' can cause invalid-read-syntax.
;;             Removed `ys--take-care-of-redo' entries prior to saving history.
;;             Adjusted window-width for the visualizer buffer window.
;;
;; 2017-05-19  @lawlist:  bug-fix to `undo-tree-label-nodes--two-of-two'.
;;             Added code to deal with labeling `0` nth-position of initial
;;             node when it is a branch-point.
;;
;; 2017-05-18  @lawlist:  submitted initial draft to Dr. Cubitt just in case he
;;             might be interested in adding/polishing this new semi-linear feature.
